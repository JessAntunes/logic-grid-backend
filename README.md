# Logic Grid: Backend

Logic Grid is a website for those who love logic puzzles, but wants a site that has a calm, modern interface that allows for easier concentration without the distractions of ads and pop-ups.  

This is the rails API that provides the games, solutions, and highscores for the game using a PostgreSQL databse. Please use in conjunction with Logic Grid: Frontend or create your own.
